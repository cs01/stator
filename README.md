Statorgfc is a JavaScript library for state management of JavaScript apps, with built-in support for React Components.

* **Predictable global state**: state management occurs in one location -- a variable named *store*.
* **Intuitive API**: API is similar to React's, with no boilerplate code to use
* **Typesafe**: state properties can only be replaced with data of the same type
* **Immutable... or not**: You choose if you want to work with immutable data structures by setting a boolean
* **Simple**: Written in plain JavaScript. No dependencies.
